# C# 12 Design Patterns: Factory and Abstract Factory (CSharp12-DesignPatterns-Factory-AbstractFactory)

## Overview
In this repository, you will find examples of Factory and Abstract Factory design patterns in C# 12. These patterns simplify creating complex objects and enhance code maintainability, scalability, and overall navigation.

## Key Concepts

### Factory Pattern
Factory patterns encapsulate object creation, allowing clients to create objects without specifying their exact class. They facilitate loose coupling and simplify object management.

**Components:**
- `IProduct`: Interface for products.
- `ConcreteProductA` & `ConcreteProductB`: Specific product implementations.
- `IFactory`: Interface for the factory method.
- `ConcreteFactoryA` & `ConcreteFactoryB`: Specific factory implementations.
- `Client`: Uses the factory to create products.

### Abstract Factory Pattern
It facilitates the management of product variations because it allows families of related objects to be used together, extending the Factory Pattern.

**Components:**
- Interfaces and concrete classes similar to those in the Factory Pattern, adapted to support multiple product families.

## Implementation

### Running the Example

To see the Factory Pattern in action:
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/ziggyrafiq/CSharp12-DesignPatterns-Factory-AbstractFactory.git`
2. Open the solution in Visual Studio.
3. Build and run the project to see how different factories create specific products.

### Example Code

```csharp
using FactoryAndAbstractFactoryDemo;

Console.WriteLine("Hello, from Ziggy Rafiq!");
// Client usage with Concrete Factory A
IFactory factoryA = new ConcreteFactoryA();
Client clientA = new Client(factoryA);
Console.WriteLine(clientA.ClientCode());

// Client usage with Concrete Factory B
IFactory factoryB = new ConcreteFactoryB();
Client clientB = new Client(factoryB);
Console.WriteLine(clientB.ClientCode());

```
